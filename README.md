# Rolling-Dice

This program takes in three user inputs.  The user specifies how many sides each die can have
(with posible values for each die ranging from 1 to N, where N is the number of sides), the amount of
dice to roll, and finally, the number of trials.  For each trial, the values of each die are added together
and the sum is recorded as a data point.  At the end of a run, a histogram of values is displayed along
with stats such as the mean, standard deviation, and the max and min values of the rolls.
